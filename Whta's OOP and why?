### ðŸ”· What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

**OOP** is a **programming paradigm** â€” a way to think about and organize your code â€” based on the concept of "**objects**".

An **object** is a combination of:

* **Data** (also called attributes or properties)
* **Functions** (also called methods) that work on that data

Instead of writing code as a set of steps (procedures), **you structure it around real-world entities** like `Car`, `Person`, `BankAccount`, etc.

#### ðŸ§± OOP is built on 4 key principles:

1. **Encapsulation**: Grouping data and the code that works on it in a single unit (class). It also hides internal details from the outside (data protection).
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only whatâ€™s necessary (like using a car without knowing the engine internals).
3. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones (e.g., `Truck` inherits from `Vehicle`).
4. **Polymorphism**: Using a unified interface to represent different underlying data types (e.g., different shapes like `Circle`, `Rectangle` can all use a common `draw()` method).

### âœ… Why use OOP?

OOP helps with:

* **Organizing complex code** in a logical way
* **Reusability** of code using classes and inheritance
* **Maintainability** and easier debugging
* **Real-world modeling**, making code intuitive (e.g., think of a `BankAccount` class rather than just `balance`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()` as separate things)

### ðŸ”„ OOP vs. FP (Functional Programming)

| Feature               | OOP (Object-Oriented)                    | FP (Functional Programming)                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Focus**             | Objects and their interactions           | Pure functions and data transformations          |
| **Data**              | Bundled with methods inside objects      | Separate from functions, often immutable         |
| **State/Mutability**  | Encourages changing object state         | Avoids changing state (pure functions preferred) |
| **Code structure**    | Classes and objects                      | Functions and recursion                          |
| **Example languages** | C++, Java, Python (can support both)     | Haskell, Lisp, Elixir, JavaScript (FP-friendly)  |
| **Ease of testing**   | Moderate (state can make testing harder) | High (pure functions = predictable)              |

### ðŸ“Œ Example in C++

#### OOP (Object-Oriented):

```cpp
class Dog {
private:
    string name;
public:
    Dog(string n) { name = n; }
    void bark() { cout << name << " says woof!" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog("Buddy");
    myDog.bark();
}
```

#### FP-style (Functional):

```cpp
void bark(string name) {
    cout << name << " says woof!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    bark("Buddy");
}
```

Both do the same thing, but the **OOP version creates an object** and groups its data (`name`) with behavior (`bark()`), while the **FP version separates data and functions**.

---

### ðŸ§  Summary

* **OOP** is about **objects**, combining data and behavior.
* **FP** is about **functions**, focusing on pure computation without side effects.
* Both are useful and have different strengths.
* C++ supports **both paradigms**, which gives you flexibility.
