## What is a Constructor?

A **constructor** is a special member function in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created (instantiated). Its main purpose is to **initialize the object** — for example, to set initial values for data members or to allocate resources.

---

## Key Characteristics of Constructors

* **Same name as the class:** The constructor function has exactly the same name as the class.
* **No return type:** Constructors do not have a return type — not even `void`.
* **Automatically called:** You don’t call the constructor explicitly. It is invoked automatically when an object is created.
* **Can be overloaded:** You can have multiple constructors with different parameters (called constructor overloading).
* **Default constructor:** A constructor with no parameters is called a *default constructor*.

## Why are Constructors Useful?

* To **ensure an object starts life in a valid state** by initializing member variables.
* To simplify code by **automatically handling setup** when an object is created.
* To avoid forgetting to initialize important data, which can lead to bugs.

## Example

```cpp
class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    // Constructor: same name as class, no return type
    Person(string personName, int personAge) {
        name = personName;
        age = personAge;
        cout << "Constructor called: " << name << ", " << age << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person p1("Alice", 30);  // Constructor called automatically
    Person p2("Bob", 25);

    cout << p1.name << " is " << p1.age << " years old." << endl;
    cout << p2.name << " is " << p2.age << " years old." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Types of Constructors

1. **Default constructor:** Takes no arguments (or all parameters have default values).

   ```cpp
   Person() {
       name = "Unknown";
       age = 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Parameterized constructor:** Takes arguments to initialize members with specific values.

3. **Copy constructor:** Initializes an object using another object of the same class.

   ```cpp
   Person(const Person &other) {
       name = other.name;
       age = other.age;
   }
   ```

## Additional Notes

* If you don’t write any constructor, C++ provides a default constructor that does nothing (default initializes members).
* If you define any constructor yourself, C++ does *not* generate a default constructor automatically.
* Constructors can be used to allocate dynamic memory or open files — anything needed to set up the object.

## Summary

| Aspect            | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Initialize objects upon creation                                  |
| Name              | Same as the class                                                 |
| Return type       | None (not even `void`)                                            |
| When called       | Automatically when an object is created                           |
| Can be overloaded | Yes, you can have multiple constructors with different parameters |
| Usefulness        | Ensures objects start with valid initial state, prevents errors   |
