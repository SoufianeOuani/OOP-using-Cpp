## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is a Virtual Function?**

A **virtual function** in C++ is a member function in the base class that is declared using the keyword `virtual`.
It allows **runtime polymorphism** ‚Äî meaning the function that gets executed is determined **at runtime**, based on the **actual type of the object**, not the type of the pointer or reference.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Why do we use it?**

Without `virtual`, C++ uses **static binding** ‚Äî the function call is decided at compile time based on the type of the pointer/reference.
With `virtual`, C++ uses **dynamic binding** ‚Äî the function call is decided at runtime based on the actual object.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Example (Without vs With `virtual`)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void Show() { // virtual function
        cout << "Base Show()\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void Show() override { // override the base function
        cout << "Derived Show()\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* ptr;
    Derived d;
    ptr = &d;

    ptr->Show(); // ‚úÖ Prints "Derived Show()" because of virtual
    return 0;
}
```

üîπ Without `virtual`, the output would be `"Base Show()"` because the pointer type is `Base*`.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **How does it work internally?**

When you declare a function as `virtual`:

* The compiler creates a **vtable** (virtual table) for that class.
* Each object has a hidden **vptr** (virtual pointer) pointing to its class‚Äôs vtable.
* When you call a virtual function, the vtable is checked at runtime to decide which function to execute.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Pure Virtual Functions**

You can make a function **pure virtual** by assigning `= 0`, which makes the class **abstract** (cannot be instantiated).
Example:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void Draw() = 0; // pure virtual function
};
```
