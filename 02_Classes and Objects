## 🧱 What is a Class?

A **class** is like a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects.

It defines:

* **Data** (called *attributes* or *member variables*)
* **Behavior** (called *functions* or *methods*)

Example: A blueprint of a `Car` — it says a car has `color`, `speed`, and it can `drive()` or `brake()`.

## 📦 What is an Object?

An **object** is a **real instance** of a class — a specific car like "Red Toyota moving at 60km/h".

Each object has:

* Its **own data**
* It can use the **methods** defined in the class

## ✅ Syntax in C++

### 👷 Defining a class:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        cout << brand << " is driving at " << speed << " km/h." << endl;
    }
};
```

### 🚗 Creating an object:

```cpp
int main() {
    Car myCar;            // create object
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.speed = 100;

    myCar.drive();        // call method
}
```

## 🔍 Explanation

| Part              | Meaning                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `class Car`       | You’re defining a blueprint called `Car`.  |
| `public:`         | Makes things accessible outside the class. |
| `brand` & `speed` | Attributes (variables) of the object.      |
| `drive()`         | Method — function inside the class.        |
| `myCar`           | Object (actual car with real values).      |

## 🔒 Access Specifiers

You often see:

* `public:` — accessible outside the class
* `private:` — accessible **only inside** the class
* `protected:` — accessible in child classes (inheritance)

### Example:

```cpp
class Person {
private:
    int age; // can't access directly from outside

public:
    void setAge(int a) {
        age = a;
    }

    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
};
```

## 🧠 Analogy

| Concept   | Real World                  |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Class     | Blueprint of a phone        |
| Object    | A real iPhone or Samsung    |
| Attribute | Color, battery, camera      |
| Method    | Call(), Text(), TakePhoto() |
